    "\n",
    "To select a cell, click in the left margin next to the cell.  You should see a blue frame surrounding the selected cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To edit a code cell, click inside the cell.  You should see a green frame around the selected cell, and you should see a cursor inside the cell.\n",

    "1.  From the Insert menu select \"Insert cell below\" to add a cell below this one.  By default, you get a code cell, as you can see in the pulldown menu that says \"Code\".\n",
